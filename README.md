# HTML Practice

Created by Justin Zhang

## About

This is my walkthrough of the [HTML Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training) on LinkedInLearning.

This is also a way for me to try Markdown.

## Folders

The **Practice** folder is for me to take notes while watching the videos and to try things out.

The **03_09** folder is the challenge for chapter 3.

        <h2>Subheading with h2 tag</h2>
        <h3>Adding headings</h3>
        <p>Here is some text under the first subheading. Headings help define structure and hierarchy of content. They should be used consistently to plan out the website. Don't SKIP a series of headings (i.e. always go in order from h1, h2, ... and don't jump to hx+2).</p>
        <h3>Using Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>Use the paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) for each block or paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>Every new paragraph should have its own set of tags.</p>
        <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
        <p>The line break tag (&lang;br&rang;) makes a new line without a new paragraph, known as a "soft return". These are inline (can be used within headers an paragraphs and do NOT require a closing tag).</p>

        <!-- the b tag is PURELY VISUAL... does not have any symantic value-->
        <dl><h1>Tags</h1><!-- dl is for description list
            <dt><b>The Bold Tag</b></dt><!-- dt is for the description term of a list-->
            <dd>This is the <em>definition</em> here... And this is one <b>bolded</b> word.</dd><!-- dd is for the description definition of the term in the list-->
            <dt><strong>The Strong Tag</strong></dt>
                <dd>This looks just like the bold tag... but it actually has some meaning. This will affect screen readers and other interpreters. Originally the b tag was removed, but HTML5 brought it back because there could be cases where you wanted to bold something but not interpret it strongly.</dd>
            <dt><i>The Italic Tag</i></dt>
                <dd>This i tag makes text italicized.</dd>
            <dt><em>The Emphasis Tag</em></dt>
                <dd>This looks just like the <i>i</i> tag above, but the text is actually emphasized more than the text around it symantically. Although this tag is usually rendered in <i>italics</i>, it shouldn't be used in place of the italics tag, rather it should be used for text that needs to be emphasized for some reason.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Essentially, one set of tags is <em>presentational</em>, while the other is <em>logical</em>

        <dt>Named Character Entities<dt>
            <dd>Use &amp; followed by the <strong>named entity</strong>. Other examples are &quot;&amp;copy&semi;&quot; for &copy; and &quot;&amp;trade&semi;&quot; for &trade;.</dd>
        <dt>Whitespace</dt>
            <dd>Only the first whitespace after a word is used, unless the &quot;&amp;nbsp&semi;&quot; named entity is explicitly designated for more whitespace like this [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] However, do <strong>NOT</strong> use this for formatting! (use CSS <em>of course</em>).

<!-- In html4, block-level content model refers to how adding additional paragraphs all adds new "blocks" of paragraphs, while inline content model refers to how you can modify text inside of text-->
<!-- In html5, there is Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning-->
<!-- Use headings based on the content hierarchy, not the size. CSS is designed to take care of all styling/visual formatting-->
<!-- The browser will often have some default formatting which can make it LOOK like the info is formatted how you want, when it actually isn't-->
<!-- XML required a closing tag <p />(self-closing), but HTML does nto require it-->
